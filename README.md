MIMUW 19/20 Data Analysis and Visualisation Homework 2

Given the data from The Word Bank:
https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?end=2018&start=1960&view=chart
do animated bar plots (gif file) for all years for:

a) 5 most populated countries (filter out groups like South Asia, OECD, etc.)

b) pick one country and year at random and then find 4 other countries that are the closest by 
population size (either + or -) in given year and do similar plot (e.g., Chile at 1985 and 4 other countries)

c) the same as (b) but this time use Poland as "the centroid"

The report regarding point 2 should be made in HTML. Plus three plots and 
three python scripts should be added to the project folder. All files 
should be send until 15.03.2020 via email to lukaskoz@mimuw.edu.pl 
with the email subject: 'lab3_hw_Name_Surname' without email text body and with 
'lab3_hw_Name_Surname.7z' (without Polish letters) attachment.
